# Web-Scraper
This was my Upwork project in which I was supposed to create a python Web Scraper script I used BeautifulSoup for Scraping the website (This website is given by the client it was like housing website were on the input you give the postal code and the scripts Scrape the data). The list of postal code was provided by the client you can see 'All_postalCodes.xlsx' file and output.csv is the output file in which all the scraped data is stored. In this project, I used the BeautifulSoup module for web scraping.
